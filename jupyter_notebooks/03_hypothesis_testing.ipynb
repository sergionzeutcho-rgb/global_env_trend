    "## Purpose and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook validates the project hypotheses using simple, transparent statistical tests. Rather than treating the data as a black box, we explicitly test our research questions and document the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection to project guidelines is strong across several areas. For ethics, hypothesis-driven analysis reduces p-hacking (fishing for significant results). For communication, each hypothesis is stated in plain English before technical testing. For transparency, we document both expected and unexpected findings, including limitations. For social impact, climate findings can influence policy, so we're careful about our claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses stated upfront are: First, higher CO2 emissions per capita is associated with higher average temperature. Second, higher renewable energy percentage is associated with lower CO2 emissions. Third, extreme weather events increase over time from 2000 to 2024. Fourth and optionally, higher forest area is associated with fewer extreme events.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical limitation is that all tests measure association, not causation. We cannot claim \"X causes Y\" based on correlation alone. The dashboard will clearly communicate this to avoid misleading users.\n",

    "# H3: Extreme weather events trend over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis in plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect extreme weather events (storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves) to increase over the 2000-2024 period as global temperatures rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is important is that extreme weather events have direct human and economic impacts. Tracking trends helps public awareness of climate risks, policy planning for disaster preparedness, and resource allocation for vulnerable regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we test this is by calculating the average number of extreme events per year globally, then looking for an upward trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the results requires consideration of several scenarios. An increasing trend supports the hypothesis that extreme events are becoming more frequent. A stable or decreasing trend may indicate improved reporting, data quality issues, or regional variations that cancel out globally. Large year-to-year variability reflects natural climate cycles like El Niño and La Niña that create fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data quality consideration is that extreme weather event counts may suffer from reporting bias (better monitoring in recent years), definition inconsistencies across countries, and missing data for developing nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll document these limitations in the dashboard to ensure users understand the uncertainty."

    "# H4 (optional): Forest area percent vs extreme events or rainfall volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis in plain English:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check if countries with more forest coverage experience fewer extreme weather events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale is that forests provide ecosystem services that can buffer against climate impacts. They absorb rainfall and reduce flooding. They regulate local temperatures. They stabilize soil and prevent erosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect a negative correlation, meaning higher forest area is associated with fewer extreme events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important caveats include several confounding factors. Forest coverage correlates with development level, geography, and climate zone. Directionality is unclear because we don't know if forests reduce extreme events, or if regions with fewer events naturally preserve forests. Event types matter because forests may reduce flooding but have less effect on droughts or cyclones. Data challenges arise because forest area and extreme event definitions vary by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "For responsible reporting, even if we find a correlation, we cannot claim forest conservation directly prevents extreme weather without controlled studies. We'll frame any findings as \"associated with\" rather than \"caused by\" in our dashboard communications."
