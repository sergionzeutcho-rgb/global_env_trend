    "## Purpose and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a simple, explainable forecasting model to project temperature trends for 2025-2029. We prioritize transparency over complexity to ensure stakeholders can understand and appropriately trust (or question) the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection to project guidelines spans multiple learning outcomes. For ethics, transparent modeling prevents \"black box\" predictions that obscure uncertainty. For communication, simple models like linear regression are easier to explain than complex machine learning algorithms. For limitations, we explicitly document what the model cannot do (no confidence intervals, no exogenous factors, linear assumption). For responsible use, the dashboard will clearly label forecasts as exploratory projections, not definitive predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why simple models matter is an important consideration. Complex models like neural networks or ensemble methods might fit historical data better, but we only have about 25 years per country, which creates overfitting risk with small datasets. Non-technical users need to understand how predictions are made. Ethical AI practice requires explainability, especially for public-facing climate tools. Simpler models make limitations more obvious, reducing false confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model limitations we acknowledge include five key areas. The linear trend assumption means real climate may accelerate or plateau rather than follow a straight line. No external factors means we ignore emissions changes, policy, and economic shifts. Short time series means only 2000-2024 data is available per country. No uncertainty quantification means we provide point estimates only, without confidence intervals. Past trends may not continue if future conditions change dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard will communicate these limitations clearly to prevent overreliance on the forecasts.\n",

We remove duplicates to ensure each Country-Year combination appears only once. We sort by Country and Year to keep time series organized for each country. We define the split year of 2018, meaning we'll train models on 2000-2018 and test on 2019-2024. We define the forecast horizon to predict 5 years into the future, from 2025 to 2029.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each country, we follow a specific process. We split data chronologically at 2018 (train: 2000-2018, test: 2019-2024). We fit a simple linear regression using only Year as a predictor. We evaluate on the test period (2019-2024) using MAE and RMSE. We generate forecasts for 2025-2029.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why linear regression? We chose the simplest possible model for important reasons. Transparency means it's easy to explain to non-technical audiences (\"temperature increases by X degrees per year\"). Explainability means decision-makers can understand and trust the logic. Limited data means we only have about 25 years per country, so complex models would overfit. Ethical practice means we avoid black-box models that obscure uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the metrics helps interpret model performance. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the average prediction error in degrees Celsius, where lower is better. For example, MAE equals 0.5°C means predictions are typically off by half a degree. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) penalizes larger errors more heavily, where lower is better. For example, RMSE equals 0.7°C means predictions have about 0.7°C typical deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model limitations we must communicate include several critical factors. Short time series means only 25 years of data per country limits accuracy. Linear assumption means real climate trends may accelerate or plateau (non-linear). No exogenous factors means we ignore emissions, policy changes, and economic shifts. Uncertainty not quantified means we provide point estimates, not confidence intervals. Past does not equal future because historical trends may not continue if conditions change dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible use in the dashboard requires clear communication. The dashboard will label forecasts clearly as \"projections based on historical trends.\" It will include a disclaimer about model simplicity and limitations. It will encourage users to view forecasts as exploratory, not definitive. It will avoid making policy recommendations based solely on these predictions."
